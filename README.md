# UFOs
## Overview of Project
Organize and present UFO recorded data through a fully dynamic table.
### Purpose
Present results of a database in which the user of a website can interact with the data through filters. It is via these filters that an understanding of UFOs phenomena can be studied and understood.
## Results
When the website is accessed, all data will be present by default; by inputting values in the filter search the data can be sorted

For example filtering by state:

Continue to reducing the results by filtering by city:

Keep fitering there are endless possibilities!

To start over just refresh the website

## Summary
### Design Drawback
The main drawback for this design is shsown after finalizing filtering the data, if the user wants to start a new search the website needs to be refreshed
### Further development
Create a "Clear Filters" button, it will be possible to start a new search every time
Add a "Time Interval" filter with 2 inputs (Min and Max), the user will be able to see events that match their desired time duration
A drop down for City, State, Country, and Shape would enhance the user experience, specially if they are not familiar with the data
